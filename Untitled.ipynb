    "# Pipeline for Detecting a KanMX Insertion at the Yeast CHZ1 (YER030W)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline comprises the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FASTQ reading and quality summary – Confirm read count, length, and quality distribution.\n",
    "2. Align reads to reference (Bowtie2) – Map sequencing reads to the S288C reference genome (which lacks the KanMX insertion) to see how CHZ1 is covered.\n",
    "3. Parse alignments for coverage and clipping – Examine alignment coverage across the CHZ1 locus and identify reads with soft-clips (which may indicate partial alignment due to the insertion).\n",
    "4. Search for KanMX-specific sequences – Scan reads for known KanMX cassette sequences (primer tails and internal motifs) to directly detect the insertion.\n",
    "5. Compile evidence and interpret – Combine the findings to determine if CHZ1 is fully replaced by KanMX, and discuss confidence in the result."

    "First, we load the sequencing reads from the FASTQ file and get basic statistics: number of reads, read lengths, and quality scores. We can use Biopython’s Bio.SeqIO module to parse the FASTQ, which yields SeqRecord objects for each [read](https://biopython.org/wiki/SeqIO#:~:text=Aims). Biopython assumes Sanger FASTQ format by default (Phred+33 quality encoding)[https://biopython.org/wiki/SeqIO#:~:text=fastq,See%20also%20the%20incompatible%20%E2%80%9Cfastq]. For efficiency with large files, one could also use Bio.SeqIO.QualityIO.FastqGeneralIterator."

We will rely on multiple reads and possibly overlapping pairs (if paired-end) to cover the locus. If CHZ1 has been knocked out, we expect anomalies in how these reads map to the reference genome at that location – which we will assess in the next steps."
