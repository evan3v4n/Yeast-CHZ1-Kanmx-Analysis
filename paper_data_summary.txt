FIGURE LEGENDS:

Figure 1: Schematic of CHZ1::KanMX insertion showing wild-type and mutant alleles
Schematic representation of CHZ1 gene disruption. Top: Wild-type CHZ1 locus. Bottom: CHZ1::KanMX mutant showing kanamycin resistance cassette insertion.

Figure 2: Detailed view of insertion junction with restriction sites
Molecular details of the insertion junction. Genomic CHZ1 sequence (green) transitions to kanamycin cassette (red) at the SalI-BamHI junction. Restriction sites are marked.

Figure 3: Sequencing read coverage across insertion site
Distribution of sequencing reads across the insertion site. Upstream reads (n=178), junction reads (n=32), and cassette reads (n=13) are shown.

Figure 4: Restriction map of integrated cassette
Restriction enzyme map of the integrated cassette showing positions of SalI, BamHI, PacI, and AscI sites.


RECOMMENDED NEXT EXPERIMENTS:
1. PCR verification with external primers
2. Southern blot to confirm single integration
3. Phenotypic analysis (MMS and benomyl sensitivity)
4. Complementation test with wild-type CHZ1
