Insertion appears to be at the expected site in CHZ1

=== Recommendations ===
1. Perform PCR verification with primers flanking the insertion
2. Sequence the PCR product to confirm correct insertion
3. Check for any unwanted mutations in flanking regions
4. Verify loss of CHZ1 function if doing knockout
