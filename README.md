# Yeast CHZ1 Kanamycin Insertion Analysis

This project provides visualization and analysis tools for studying the insertion of a Kanamycin resistance cassette (KanMX) into the CHZ1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

## Overview

The CHZ1 gene (YER030W) encodes a histone chaperone for Htz1p/H2A-H2B dimer in yeast. This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the targeted disruption of this gene using a Kanamycin resistance cassette insertion.
